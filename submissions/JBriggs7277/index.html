                <h3>Getting Lelu</h3>
                <p>I grew up in a low income, broken home.  I didn't have a lot of chances to get things that I wanted.<br/>
                    When I crossed over into adulthood, I vowed to live a life more luxurious than my upbringing.  I had always wanted <br/>
                    a Siberian Husky.  Once I had bought my house, and was established, I decided it was time to find the perfect dog.<br/>
                    I ended up traveling 5 hours away near the western edge of Missouri, where I found a Husky breeder, and met Lelu.<br/>
                    I instantly fell in love.  She was perfect, and she was all mine.  The start of a great friendship.</p>
                <h3>Lelu's new home</h3>
                <p>At the time, I had a roommate living with me.  He had gotten an Australian Sheppard named Oliver.  When, I brought<br/>
                    Lelu home, Oliver immediately realized he had buddy to run around our gigantic backyard with.  Lelu was born 2 days before <br/>
                    Christmas.  Her first big snow was the night she came home with me.  She and Olly had a blast running around in the snow that night.</p>
                <h3>All Grown Up</h3>
                <p>Today, Lelu is almost 2 years old.  She has grown up into quite the dog.  She can do several tricks, except for speaking,<br/>
                    for some reason, Husky's are very quiet dogs.  She can do it, it just takes some coaxing.  She still has puppy tendencies<br/>
                    to chew on shoes, and make messes in the house.  Through all of that though, I wouldn't change it for the world.  She's<br/>
                    not the Husky I always pictured having.  She doesn't have a big fur coat, she's rather small.  Regardless, she's the best<br/>
                    dog a man could hope for.
